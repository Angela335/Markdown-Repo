~~This text is strikethrough~~

---
# Superscript and Subscript:

I can put things in superscript <Sup> Like this </Sup>

Or I can put them in subscript <Sub> Like this </Sub>

---
# Lists:

You can make a bulleted list using:
+ plus (+)
+ asterisk
+ dash (-)

Or you can make a numbered list:
1. one
2. two 
3. three

You can make task lists too:
+ [x] Complete Markdown Demo
+ [ ] Do other stuff
+ [ ] Maybe take a nap

# Block Quotes:

> You can make a block quote using Command+Shift+. on Mac or using the > key.
>> This is still part of the same block quote, but has been nested using >>.
>>> I can nest even further using >>>.
>Now I've returned to the original block quote.

# Boxes:

<table><tr><td>This text has a box around it </td></tr></table>

---
# Links:

I can also add links, like this link to [Google](https://www.google.com/)

---
# Multiple lines:

I can make\
this text use\
multiple lines\ 
by using the backslash\

# Tables:

This is a table I made to show I can make tables:

| Letters | Numbers | Symbols |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| a       | 0       | !       |
| b       | 1       | @       |
| c       | 2       | #       |
| d       | 3       | $       |
| e       | 4       | %       |
| f       | 5       | ^       |

(Obsidian automatically makes tables for me)
